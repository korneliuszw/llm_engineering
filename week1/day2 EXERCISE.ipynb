    "\n",
    "It seems strange, right? We just used OpenAI code to call Ollama?? What's going on?!\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the scoop:\n",
    "\n",
    "The python class `OpenAI` is simply code written by OpenAI engineers that makes calls over the internet to an endpoint.  \n",
    "\n",
    "When you call `openai.chat.completions.create()`, this python code just makes a web request to the following url: \"https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Code like this is known as a \"client library\" - it's just wrapper code that runs on your machine to make web requests. The actual power of GPT is running on OpenAI's cloud behind this API, not on your computer!\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenAI was so popular, that lots of other AI providers provided identical web endpoints, so you could use the same approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "So Ollama has an endpoint running on your local box at http://localhost:11434/v1/chat/completions  \n",
    "And in week 2 we'll discover that lots of other providers do this too, including Gemini and DeepSeek.\n",
    "\n",
    "And then the team at OpenAI had a great idea: they can extend their client library so you can specify a different 'base url', and use their library to call any compatible API.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's it!\n",
    "\n",
    "So when you say: `ollama_via_openai = OpenAI(base_url='http://localhost:11434/v1', api_key='ollama')`  \n",
    "Then this will make the same endpoint calls, but to Ollama instead of OpenAI."

       "Okay, let me look at this email. The user is a student who needs to ask their lecturer about grading details for a course called Przetwarzania Rozproszonego. The main points are: they want to know the final conversion ratios for each part of the course and how the 3.5 grade was calculated because they couldn't find this info on the course website. They mention someone else asked about the 40-40-20 split and their own calculations don't match their received grade of 3.0.\n",
       "\n",
       "First, I need to check for grammar, spelling, and proper respect. The original starts with \"Szanowany Panie Doktorze,\" which is correct. But maybe \"Szanowny Panie Doktorze\" is more formal. The body seems okay but could be more structured and polite.\n",
       "\n",
       "The user wrote \"chciałbym się dowiedzieć\" – that's correct. However, the phrase \"bo nie znalazłem tych informacji na enauczaniu\" has a typo: \"enauczaniu\" should be \"enauczaniu\" (corrected). Also, \"zrobilIśmy\" has a typo with the capital I, should be \"zrobiliśmy.\" \n",
       "\n",
       "The structure could be improved. Starting with a subject line, then a clear request. The current email is a bit abrupt. Maybe separate the request into paragraphs for clarity. Also, the user mentions someone else asked about the 40-40-20 split. Including that might add context but could be better phrased to show they're not just asking randomly.\n",
       "\n",
       "I should make sure the tone is respectful and polite. The original uses \"Szanowny Panie Doktorze\" which is appropriate, but maybe adding \"z wyrazami szacunku\" at the end is okay, though sometimes it's placed after the signature. Also, the user's ID and group are at the end, which is acceptable.\n",
       "\n",
       "In the response, I'll correct the typos, restructure the email for clarity, and ensure the tone is appropriate. The user should mention their student ID and group, which they did. The suggestion to add the course title in the subject line is good. Also, making sure the explanation of their calculations is clear without sounding confrontational.\n",
       "\n",
       "So, the revised email will have a proper subject line, correct grammar, structured paragraphs, and maintain the respect towards the lecturer. The user should also check the course website again to confirm there's no info there, as the original email mentions that. The final note to the lecturer should be polite and not accusatory.\n",
